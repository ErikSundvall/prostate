## AI Response 1 (GPT-5)
I’ll start by clarifying the scope and choices so I can draft a focused PRD for the interactive prostate SVG widget.

Clarifying questions
Please pick options (A/B/C/…) or add brief notes where needed.

###1. Primary goal and usage
A) View-only: visualize zones and highlight lesions based on provided data
B) Interactive marking: users click zones to mark lesions; app outputs selected zones
C) Both A and B
D) Other (describe)
### 2. Target users
A) Radiologists entering findings
B) MDT coordinators preparing summaries
C) Researchers/data entry staff
D) Mixed (specify)
E) Other
### 3. Scope of “map” views to include (first iteration)
A) Only the 2D schematic maps as in the PDF (no DICOM/MR viewer)
B) Add simple annotations/notes per lesion zone
C) Add basic PI‑RADS score per lesion
D) Other (describe)
### 4. Zone system and naming
The proposed scheme is [1-4][A/B/C][v/d] with 1=rightmost, 4=leftmost; A=base, B=mid, C=apex; v=ventral, d=dorsal.
A) Use exactly this scheme as the canonical IDs (e.g., 1Cv)
B) Use this scheme but also display Swedish labels
C) Use guideline’s exact zone list if it differs (we’ll map to IDs)
D) Other/need confirmation on any differences
### 5. Number of zones per level
A) 4 (left-right quartiles) × 2 (v/d) × 3 levels (A/B/C) = 24 total zones
B) Another count as per guideline (provide details or link/section)
C) Not sure—use best approximation for v1 and allow updates
### 6. Interaction model (if interactive)
A) Click to toggle zone selection
B) Shift-click or right-click opens a small detail panel (notes/PI‑RADS)
C) Multi-select by dragging
D) Keyboard navigation also required
E) Other
### 7. Visual design

B) Only one lesion per zone
C) Zone color indicates “any lesion present”; detail panel lists all
D) Tie-break rules (specify), e.g., highest PI‑RADS dictates color

If helpful, you can answer by listing question numbers with your choices, e.g.:

C; 2) A; 3) A,B; 4) A; 5) A; 6) A,B; 7) B,G; 8) A,D,E; 9) D,F,H,I; 10) A,B,C; 11) A,C,D; 12) A,B,C,G; 13) A,B,C; 14) A,C; 15) A,B; 16) C,D
Once I have your selections, I’ll draft the PRD and save it to the tasks folder with the next sequence number.

## Human feedback
1. A
2. B & D (Widget will be seen by all staff present at MDT
3. A & B - PI-RADS will already be availabl in incoming data
4. A for IDs of zonse (But regarding option B make the app/widget itself bilingual so that explanations/labels/hints can be switched between languages, in the widget settings)
5. A
6. B (Note that a lesion can span multiple zones and comments etc are per lesion rather than per zone. Usually maximum the three lesions are described due to time/resource limitations)
7. B
8. A & D (Note that a lesion can span multiple zones as described above)
9. D, H & K 
10. A & B
11. A (also, a lesion can span many zones)
12. A, C, G, H
13. A, B, C, D ara all non goals
14. A but make widget bilingual sv & en
15. B
16. C


## AI starts working on PRD
I’m going to create the PRD file with your selected requirements and save it to the tasks folder using the next sequence number (0001).

Created 0001-prd-prostate-mri-zone-map-widget.md

Completed (2/5) Determine next PRD sequence

I drafted the PRD based on your selections and saved it with the next sequence number.

### actions taken
Picked the next sequence (tasks folder was empty → 0001)
Created 0001-prd-prostate-mri-zone-map-widget.md with all required sections and your choices incorporated
Framed it as a view-only, bilingual, Web Component that renders a 24-zone SVG map, supports JSON import/export, multiple lesions per zone, and inspect-only details
### files changed
0001-prd-prostate-mri-zone-map-widget.md — Full PRD for the prostate MRI zone map widget
### highlights
Canonical zone IDs: [1-4][A|B|C][v|d] (e.g., 1Cv), total 24 zones
Bilingual UI (sv/en) toggle; IDs remain canonical
View-only: loads lesions from JSON, supports export (round-trip)
Multiple lesions per zone and lesions spanning zones
Zone color reflects highest PI‑RADS in that zone; legend + colorblind-safe palette
Inspect-only panel via click/Shift-click/right-click + keyboard access
Web Component packaging with single-file bundle and NPM package; latest Chrome/Edge + Firefox/Safari
Accessibility: keyboard focus, ARIA, non-color cues
Success criteria aligned with your picks (A, C, G, H)
## open questions to finalize
Guideline nuances: Any sub-zones or exceptions beyond the standard 24 we should include now?
Color mapping: Confirm your preferred PI‑RADS-to-color mapping and exact palette.
Detail panel fields: Include size (mm) or other fields beyond PI‑RADS and comment?
Default language and persistence: Should language preference be remembered (e.g., localStorage) or be stateless?
Data input channel: Is attribute-based inline JSON needed in v1, or is programmatic property assignment enough?
License preference: OK to proceed with MIT?
If you confirm or adjust the open questions, I’ll revise the PRD accordingly.

## Human response to open questions 
(This was spoken by human and transcribed by Windows 11's built-in Speech to text. To get a *, say asterisk, not star...)

* regarding guideline nuances no sub zones beyond the standard 24 nodes are needed in this iteration.
* Regarding colour mapping just pick whatever you think is good....we'll inspect that and change later
* detail panel fields can include size etc from the Swedish guideline We will detail them more later when we have the input data formats clarified 
* default language should be set by the surrounding application that runs the widget, in a config parameter. 
* regarding data input, yes that will likely be a JSON structure
* Licence should be Apache 2

0001-prd-prostate-mri-zone-map-widget.md +30 lines -19 lines
Completed (5/5) Revise after feedback

Thanks for the clarifications—I've updated the PRD to lock in your decisions and reduce open questions.

### actions taken
Incorporated your feedback directly into the PRD:
Confirmed 24 zones only; no sub-zones in this iteration
Added default, colorblind-safe PI‑RADS palette as a placeholder and made it configurable
Extended lesion schema with optional fields (e.g., size_mm, laterality, sequence notes) for future alignment with the Swedish guideline
Clarified language handling: stateless; set by host app via property/attribute (no persistence)
Set license to Apache-2.0
Trimmed resolved open questions; kept only what still needs confirmation later (detail fields finalization, input channel specifics, demo dataset)
Saved updates in 0001-prd-prostate-mri-zone-map-widget.md
Marked the “Revise after feedback” todo as completed
### what changed
Zone rendering: explicitly states “no sub-zones” for v1.
Bilingual UI: clarified host-controlled language; no localStorage.
Data schema: added optional fields for size and details.
Visualization: defined a default palette (configurable).
Packaging/License: added “License: Apache-2.0” in both technical and packaging sections.
Open Questions: reduced to 3 targeted items.

If you want, I can now scaffold a minimal demo project (Web Component + demo HTML + example JSON) using this PRD as the blueprint.

Current state comitted

## Human comments after reviewing 0001-prd-prostate-mri-zone-map-widget.md
Now we have switched AI from "GPT-5" to "GPT-5 mini" to save costs/quota in VS Code Copilot

* Remove the point "Support JSON import/export for round-tripping lesion data without loss" from chapter 2 (Goals) since round tripping is not meaningful for a view only component
* In chapter 2 change this point so that we will be using Deno instead of NPM for depencency management, compilation, component packaging etc so modify the part: "Ship as a framework-agnostic Web Component with a demo page and NPM package."

* In section 3 skip "As a coordinator, I want to export the data (JSON) presented by the widget to include in documentation or to re-import later, without loss."

* in chapter "4. functional requirements",
** The Subsection 3.3, clarify that a small warning text should be shown in the visualisation if there was an error during loading For example zones that were not recognised. 
** in subsection 4.3 the colour for PI-RADS 2 should not be green since that can be interpreted as "everything OK" So pck something that suits better 
** in subsection 4 also consider the option of using different patterns for different lesions so that we can combine colour representing the score and pattern representing the identified lesion. make sure that it's clearly visible when the patterns overlap so that one pattern does not hide the other.
** skip section 7 we don't need any data export in this read only version
** In section 9 note that we will change to Deno, not Node with NPM, so modify section 9.1
* in section 11 make sure three differned input data examples are provided and can be switched between (e.g, via a dropdown), also allowe end user to upload an input JSON

* In chapter 7. (Technical Considerations) modify this to reflect that we are using Deno not Node

* in chapter 8. (success metrics) skip the round-trip requirement

## AI preformed the changes
See changes in diff: https://github.com/ErikSundvall/prostate/commit/383e131cecbc2c2e6b9a50ce6807d6a5575b9a0e

TH AI then offers to start working...
```` Next steps I can take (pick one):

Scaffold a minimal Deno-based demo project with the Web Component, three example JSON files, and an upload control.
Generate the initial SVG zone map as an editable SVG file and a simple JS module that maps zone IDs to SVG element IDs.
Create a small test plan and example test cases for the mapping and visualization logic.
```
...but we resist the temptantion and instead go on to the next part of the scaffolfing by issuing the command:
