The PDF form, and the image png-files screnshotted from it, represents radiology (MRT) evaluation a prostate cancer summary that is used in a multidisciplinary pretreatment conference. The image #file:swedish-combined-image.png shows the images in better resolution but with Swedish text. Now we want to make a vector graphics based Javascript/html/svg widget, or combination of several widgets, that can show the prostate "maps" in the PNGs, but rather as SVG images that we can manipulate and colour dynamically based on selections, so that we can highlight the different zones in different colours. The zones shall be systematically named according to the three-dimentional "coordinate" system seen in the images. Name pattern examples are `1Cv` or `1Cd` where coordinate dimensions are
* 1 to 4 is a left to right division where 1 is rightmost and 4 is leftmost.
* A = base (uppermost), B = mid, C = apex (lowest)
* v = ventral (front), d = dorsal (back)
