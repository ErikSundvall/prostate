We now have a prostate visualisation map as described in readme.md and all current code, but it was mostly an experiment in letting an AI use scaffolding from:
https://github.com/snarktank/ai-dev-tasks.

Now we want to change some app behaviours and then switch to more realistic prostate map. We will tag this new feature pack 0002, so the 0001-prefixed files can now be ignored.

- Remove the numbers/badges from visualization, now we should only see the colour of highest pirads of each zone
- Patterns shall only be activated when hoovering ofer a zone - when doing this, patterns for all lesions that overlap the hovered zone should appear - and be shown ovar all zones that these lesions cover.

Make it possible to switch between prostate maps during development and test, note that any changes to maps be done in the src/assets shall be automatically copied over to the /demo directory during test, build etc. We will manually refine prostate-map-2.svg during the project.
